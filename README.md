# moofyjs
Used in one of hackathons I joined. Uses MS Project Oxford for emotion detection, and OpenCV to check if there are faces.
> Derived from a thesis I forgot to linked. The algorithm in checking the face points and determining the facial features are from there, I just translated it to javascript code.
